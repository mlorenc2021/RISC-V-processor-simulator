# RISC-V-processor-simulator

Engineered a simulator to execute RISC-V instructions on a single hardware thread, encompassing logical, arithmetic, and control flow operations. Includes features for disassembling memory contents, displaying instructions during execution, and showing register statuses, enhancing debugging and analysis capabilities. Also has a versatile CLI to configure memory size, set instruction execution limits, and toggle debugging outputs, providing flexibility and control over simulation behavior.
